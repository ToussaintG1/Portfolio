# <Toussaint's Portfolio>

## Description

This is an application for a Portfolio of Toussaint Gilbert. 
This application gives you detailed information about Toussaint
such as his age, residence, family, goals and aspirations, as well 
as future plans. The application then goes on to show images of 
Toussaint's work as well as a link to the deployed page of the work.
However, besides the first image there are no links to work as the
assignments have not been completed yet. If you move further down
you will find the contact information for Toussaint Gilbert.
His Resume is also attached by clicking on the resume tab in the 
top right corner.
