            <p>Hello! My name is Toussaint, and I'm thrilled to welcome you to my portfolio. I'm an 18-year-old aspiring computer scientist 
                born on March 7th, 2005, in the vibrant city of Chicago. Growing up in the dynamic neighborhood of Lincoln Park, I was inspired 
                by my mother, a strong businesswoman who owns a successful salon in our community. Her determination and entrepreneurial spirit 
                have influenced my own pursuit of excellence.

                From an early age, I developed a deep fascination with technology and the intricate science behind computers. This passion has 
                driven me to explore the ever-evolving world of computer science. Currently, I am pursuing a bootcamp course at Northwestern 
                University, where I am acquiring the foundational knowledge and practical skills necessary for success in this field.
                
                <br>
                <br>

                Looking ahead, I am excited to further my education at Loyola University, where I plan to pursue my master's degree in computer science. 
                My time at Northwestern has only fueled my curiosity, and I am eager to dive deeper into advanced topics and contribute to cutting-edge 
                research.
                
                Through my portfolio, I aim to showcase my projects, skills, and accomplishments in computer science. From coding languages to software 
                development and innovative applications, I am constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to expand my knowledge. I invite you to 
                explore my work and join me on this exhilarating journey into the world of technology. </p>
